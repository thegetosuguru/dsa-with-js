# ðŸ“˜ DSA with JavaScript

This repository contains my notes, code implementations, and practice exercises as I learn **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **JavaScript**.  
It serves as both a learning journal and a quick revision resource for important DSA topics like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, recursion, and sorting algorithms.

Iâ€™m following a YouTube playlist that provides clear explanations and practical examples to strengthen my DSA fundamentals in JavaScript.
